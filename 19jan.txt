Describe higher order functions.

Ans;- 
In JavaScript, a higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments, and/or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions are often used in functional programming to abstract away common patterns, such as iterating over an array and applying a function to each element.

function map(arr, fn) {
    var newArr = [];
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        newArr.push(fn(arr[i]));
    }
    return newArr;
}

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
var squaredNumbers = map(numbers, function(x) { return x * x; });
console.log(squaredNumbers); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]


Q2. write use cases + any one code example for map, filter and reduce.

Ans;-
map function is useful when you need to transform an array of data into a new array with the same length but with different values. A common use case is when you need to convert an array of numbers into an array of strings, or vice versa. 

filter function is useful when you need to filter an array based on certain criteria. A common use case is when you need to extract all the even numbers from an array of numbers
